# Evan Curtin

_Machine Learning Scientist/Engineer and former Computational Chemist_

Chicago, IL | [evanmcurtin@gmail.com](mailto:evanmcurtin@gmail.com) | github.com/ecurtin2


## SKILLS


*   5+ Years: Python (numpy, scipy, pandas, etc), Scientific / Mathematical Computing 
*   2-4 Years:git, SQL, Linux/bash, Cloud Computing (Amazon Web Services), Docker
*   2 Years: Kubernetes, Argo, Apache Spark, C++
*   Interested in: Rust, Scala, Elm, Golang


## EXPERIENCE


### Machine Learning Scientist - Capital One

#### Apr 2019 - Present, Chicago IL 

*   Created a fully automated machine learning model refit pipeline on Kubernetes with Argo. The pipeline transforms over
a Terabyte of raw data and results in a production-ready model library being trained on new data and published daily. 
This prevents about $7M loss annualized.
*   Scaled data transformation and analysis using Spark, Kubernetes and vendor platforms. The pipeline autoscales 
infrastructure on-demand and achieves >= 90% resource utilization while active and almost none during downtime.
*   Optimized model performance using hyperparameter tuning (hyperopt) and objective weighting.
*   Created CI/CD for the model training pipeline, enabling continuous iterative improvement.
*   Worked closely with business and platform partners facilitate daily model deployment.



### Data Science Engineer - Broadspire

#### Jun 2018 - Apr 2019, Chicago IL 

*   Reduced model training time by 90% by parallelization with Dask and code optimizations.
*   Greatly Accelerated model deployment to production by porting to AWS SageMaker and Lambda.
*   Exposed machine learning services as serverless API’s. 


### Graduate Research Assistant - University of Illinois
 
#### Sep 2015 - Jun 2018, Urbana IL

*   Researched quantum chemistry using high performance, parallel C++ on our supercomputer.
*   Rated as “excellent” by students as TA for Physical Chemistry and Statistical Mechanics.


## EDUCATION


### Former PhD Candidate, Chemistry, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
