# Evan Curtin, Machine Learning Engineer

Chicago, IL | [evanmcurtin@gmail.com](mailto:evanmcurtin@gmail.com) | github.com/ecurtin2


## SKILLS


*   5+ Years: Python (numpy, scipy, pandas, etc), Scientific / Mathematical Computing 
*   2-4 Years: C++, git, SQL, Linux/bash, Cloud Computing (Amazon Web Services), Docker
*   <2 Years: Kubernetes, Argo, Apache Spark
*   A few weekends: Rust, Scala, Elm, Go


## EXPERIENCE


### Machine Learning Scientist


#### Capital One, Chicago IL

_Apr 2019 - Present_



*   Created a fully automated machine learning model refit pipeline on Kubernetes with Argo. The pipeline transforms over
a Terabyte of raw data and results in a production-ready model library being trained on new data and published daily.
*   Scaled data transformation and analysis using Spark, Kubernetes and occasionally vendor platforms
*   Worked closely with business and platform teams to dramatically shorten the train-deploy cycle of a model
*   Optimized model performance using hyperparameter tuning (hyperopt) and weighting the objective to better align with business intent.


### Data Science Engineer


#### Broadspire, Chicago IL

_Jun 2018 - Apr 2019_



*   Reduced model training time by 90% by parallelization with Dask and code optimizations.
*   Greatly Accelerated model deployment to production by porting to AWS SageMaker and Lambda.
*   Exposed machine learning services as serverless RESTful API’s to provide scalability and reliability.


### Graduate Research Assistant


#### University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

_Sep 2015 - Jun 2018_



*   Developed a method for predicting how electrons align in solids using high performance, parallel C++ on the Blue Waters Supercomputer.
*   Taught Physical Chemistry, General Chemistry Lab and Stochastic Statistical Mechanics. Rated as “excellent” by students.


## EDUCATION


### Former PhD Candidate, Chemistry


#### University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

_Sep 2015 - Jun 2018_

Left after passing candidacy exam to pursue career in data science. GPA: 3.87


### MS and BS in Chemistry


#### Drexel University

_Sep 2010 - Sep 2015_

Magna Cum Laude, GPA: 3.85


## SELECTED PUBLICATION (1 of 4)



*   Evan Curtin and Karl Sohlberg. Quantifying electron transit in donor-bridge-acceptor systems using probabilistic confidence. _Journal of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry, 2018_


## Open Source

*    Quantized: Solutions to the time-dependent schroedinger equation for arbitrary potentials in 1D https://github.com/ecurtin2/quantized

## HOBBIES



*   I love to cook and made a small Food blog site [https://www.evanmcurtin.com/recipes/](https://www.evanmcurtin.com/recipes/)
*   I fall asleep to cppcon / pycon youtube videos.
