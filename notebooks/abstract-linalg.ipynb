    "Lately I've been playing around with the [anasazi](https://trilinos.org/packages/anasazi/) library. It's basically a library that implements algorithms to solve eigenvalue problems that are all completely unaware of the underling data structures. The way this is done is by implementing the algorithms in terms of an **interface**. Basically, this interface is a contract between whoever wrote the library, and whoever is using it. It's a formal way for the library writer to say \"If you give me an object that implements x, and y, this library will do Z with that object.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea is a bit... abstract. *And that's the whole point*. Two places where this idea is used constantly are the Python Standard Library and the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). In Python, any object that implements \\__iter__ and \\__next__ is automatically considered an iterable, and this opens up a ton of the standard library. In C++, similar functionality is done using iterators, the basic type that all of the STL algorithms work on. \n",
    "\n",
    "In python, for instance, this allows you to define a custom collection with \\__iter__ and \\__next__, and now you automatically get any(), all(), list() and so on, *regardless of what it is your collection does*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has the significant advantage that the algorithms and data structures you use become decoupled. Therefore to implement N algorithms on M data structures, you only need to implement N + M things around a common interface, rather than the N * M combinations of algorithms and data structures. It's never quite this amazing in practice, but it's close. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Moving Past numpy: Separating Algorithms and data structures in Linear Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "This is getting long winded. Assume for now that numpy is not doing what we need (say, we need memory - distributed matrices for our problem or something). Rather than rewrite an entire algorithm for another type, why not abstract away numpy in the first place? Then we simply need to write an interface between our algorithm and any data structure we want it to be able to use. \n",

    "**What the >^_!** it works!!!  Ok maybe I'm overexaggerating what's going on here but I've demonstrated the core idea here. This is an incredibly simple function that I'm implementing but the core idea is the same. **The duck typing of Python makes it an ideal language to implement abstract algorithms that are independent of the underling datatypes**. Can you do this type of thing in C++? Surely, but get your templates and 1200 character types ready. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also think that a lot of linear algebra algorithms are a great target for this approach. Writing a lot of the interface code is quite straightforward (it really really really looks like pseudo code) and then you just have to wrap a lot of very commonly implemented tasks anyway (inverse, dot product, etc). \n",
    "\n",
    "Then you can leverage a lot of linear algebra packages: numpy/scipy, theano, dask, pestc, trilinos, CUDABLAS, tensorflow, etc. with the same algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also do **Matrix free computation where you never even store a matrix**. This problem happens all the time if you're dealing with very large matrices that are hundreds of thousands or millions of rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe we can re implement [anasazi](https://trilinos.org/packages/anasazi/) eigensolvers at the algorithm level in python. Then we can have plug-n-play Lanczos, Arnoldi, Davidson, etc algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last thing then I'll be quiet. Imagine using this approach in conjunction with numpy as a proof of concept of your algorithm. Come production time, just write a wrapper for theano and if you do it properly you ought to be able to generate the compute graph of your entire algorithm, and let theano optimize and compile it. I really think this approach to solving problems will really shine when paired with the Python scientific stack."
