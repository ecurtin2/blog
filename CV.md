### Education
-------------
2015 - Present
Urbana, IL
:     **University of Illinois @ Urbana-Champaign**  
      *PhD in Chemistry*, GPA: 3.87  

2010 - 2015
Philadelphia, PA
:    **Drexel University**  
     *BS and MS in Chemistry*, GPA: 3.85  

### Technical Skills
--------------------

2010 - Present
:     **Data Analysis/Presentation**  
      - Automated data analysis pipelines using the Python data stack, emphasizing reproducibility
        via complete automation from data generation all the way through presentation. 
      - Presented technical information to expert and layman audiences. I prioritize clarity of 
        content by using ideas from color theory.  

2012 - Present
:     **Method Development**  
     Created models to solve problems in computational chemistry by employing techniques from Linear Algebra, Differential Equations
     and numerical optimization. My favorite approach is to distill the simplest possible model that is effective, but am not afraid
     to utilize complex models when necessary.

2012 - Present
:     **Programming**  
     Experienced in creating lightweight, rapid-iterations in scientific python, as well as highly tuned C++ scaling across a supercomputer.  
     I often cherry pick ideas from software engineering when they improve a code base.
     - **Most experience:** Python (2 and 3)
     - **Moderate experience:** C++ (C++11 onward)
     - **Some experience:** Fortran (pre-2003 standard)  

### Experience
-----------------------

2015 - Present
Urbana, IL
:     **University of Illinois @ Urbana-Champaign**  
      *Graduate Research/Teaching Assistant*   
      - Developed a method for predicting how electrons align in solids. This required the solution
      of an eigenvalue problem with hundreds of thousands of degrees of freedom, which was done using high
      performance, parallel C++ on the Blue Waters Supercomputer. 
      - Implemented a deterministic global minimum search algorithm in order to find better solutions to fundamental
	problems in theoretical chemistry and physics. 
      - Analyzed datasets bigger than 16GB out-of-memory by utilizing the HDF5 file format in conjunction with the python
	data stack (pandas, numpy, scipy, dask).    
      - Taught Physical Chemistry and General Chemistry Lab and was
      rated "excellent" by students.

2013 - 2015   
Philadelphia, PA
:     **Drexel University**  
      *Research Assistant*    
      - Created a method detemine how rapidly branched molecules vibrate with reduced computational
      complexity in Fortran 90. 
      - Invented a scheme to predict how long electrons take to move
      across a molecule in Python 3. The python module was accelerated with Numba to achieve very fast execution speed. 

Apr - Sep 2013
Spring House, PA
:     **Janssen Pharmaceuticals of Johnson & Johnson**  
      *Biologics R&D Co-op*    
      - Determine how quickly drugs bind to and release from disease targets using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR).
      This information informed high-level decisions about which drug candidates to pursue.	

Apr - Sep 2012
Exton, PA
:     **West Pharmaceutical Services**    
      *Quality Control Co-op*    
      - Analyzed company and client products with analytical chemistry techniques to 
      ensure consistency of quality, while applying cGMP and GLP practices.

Jun - Sep 2011
Philadelphia, PA
:     **Drexel University**    
      *Undergraduate Research Assistant*    
      - Curated and generated data for the
      [Open Science Melting Point and Solubility Databases
      ](http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/). 
      - This required validation of data from multiple database sources, and 
      in some cases performing the measurements to resolve discrepancies. 
      - All work was done using Open Science principles.
