### Education
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**PhD in Chemistry, 2020**
:     University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL

**BS and MS in Chemistry, 2015**
:    Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA


### Technical Skills
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Data Analysis/Presentation**  
:    Automated data analysis pipelines using the Python data stack and presented
     technical information to expert and layman audiences.

**Method Development**  
:    Created numerical models to solve problems in computational chemistry by
     employing techniques from Linear Algebra and Differential Equations.

**Programming**  
:    Experienced in creating lightweight, rapid-iterations in scientific python,
     as well as highly tuned C++ scaling across a supercomputer.  
      - **Best:** Python
      - **Good:** C++ (11 standard onwards)
      - **Have Used for a Project:** Fortran90  


### Experience
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2015 - Present
:     **University of Illinois @ Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL**  
      *Graduate Research/Teaching Assistant*   
      - Developed a method for predicting how electrons align in solids. This required the solution
      of an eigenvalue problem with hundreds of thousands of degrees of freedom, which was done using high
      performance, parallel C++ on the Blue Waters Supercomputer. 
      - Implemented a deterministic global minimum search algorithm in order to find better solutions to fundamental
	problems in theoretical chemistry and physics. 
      - Analyzed datasets bigger than 16GB out-of-memory by utilizing the HDF5 file format in conjunction with the python
	data stack (pandas, numpy, scipy, dask).    
      - Taught Physical Chemistry and General Chemistry Lab and was
      rated "excellent" by students.

2013 - 2015, Philadelpia, PA
:     **Drexel University**  
      *Research Assistant*    
      - Created a method detemine how rapidly branched molecules vibrate with reduced computational
      complexity in Fortran 90. 
      - Invented a scheme to predict how long electrons take to move
      across a molecule in Python 3. The python module was accelerated with Numba to achieve very fast execution speed. 

Apr - Sep 2013
:     **Janssen Pharmaceuticals of Johnson & Johnson, Spring House, PA**  
      *Biologics R&D Co-op*    
      - Determine how quickly drugs bind to and release from disease targets using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR).
      This information informed high-level decisions about which drug candidates to pursue.	

Apr - Sep 2012
:     **West Pharmaceutical Services, Exton, PA**    
      *Quality Control Co-op*    
      - Analyzed company and client products with analytical chemistry techniques to 
      ensure consistency of quality, while applying cGMP and GLP practices.

Jun - Sep 2011
:     **Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA**    
      *Undergraduate Research Assistant*    
      - Curated and generated data for the
      [Open Science Melting Point and Solubility Databases
      ](http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/). 
      - This required validation of data from multiple database sources, and 
      in some cases performing the measurements to resolve discrepancies. 
      - All work was done using Open Science principles.
