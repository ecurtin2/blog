### Experience
-----------------------

2015 - Present
Urbana, IL
:     **University of Illinois @ Urbana-Champaign**  
      *Graduate Research/Teaching Assistant*   
      Developed a method for predicting the phase diagram of the electron gas. This required the solution
      of an eigenvalue problem with hundreds of thousands of degrees of freedom, which was done using high
      performance, parallel C++ on the Blue Waters Supercomputer.
      Additionally, I taught Physical Chemistry and General Chemistry Lab and was
      rated "excellent" by students.

2013 - 2015   
Philadelphia, PA
:     **Drexel University**  
      *Research Assistant*    
      Created a method to analyze vibrations in branched molecules (Fortran 90)
      and to predict electron transit times (Python 3). The python module was implemented using
      just-in-time compilation to achieve speed comparable to compiled code. 

Apr - Sep 2013
Spring House, PA
:     **Janssen Pharmaceuticals of Johnson & Johnson**  
      *Biologics R&D Co-op*    
      Determined the kinetics and affinity for antibody therapeutics
      binding to disease targets using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR).

Apr - Sep 2012
Exton, PA
:     **West Pharmaceutical Services**    
      *Quality Control Co-op*    
      Analyzed company and client samples using company protocols as well as
      cGMP and GLP practices.

Jun - Sep 2011
Philadelphia, PA
:     **Drexel University**    
      *Undergraduate Research Assistant*    
      Curated and generated data for the
      [Open Science Melting Point and Solubility Databases
      ](http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/).
