### Experience
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Jun 2018 - Present**
: **Broadspire**

*Data Science Engineer*
: *Chicago, IL*

- Reduced model training and deployment time by 90% by parallelization and automation using dask, sqlalchemy, numba and general code optimizations.
- Created predictive models for high value insurance claims using sklearn and deployed to production by incorporating with company infrastructure.
- Wrote a library for internal company use to allow consistency across the data
science team and to enable improvements thereof to instantly scale across the team.
- Established best practices and software for predictive modeling to ensure model quality and monitoring in deployment, including incorporating with company logging and notification software.

**2015 - May 2018**
: **University of Illinois**

*Graduate Research/Teaching Assistant*
: *Urbana, IL*

- Developed a method for predicting how electrons align in solids using high
  performance, parallel C++ on the Blue Waters Supercomputer.
- Analyzed datasets with the HDF5 / JSON file formats in conjunction with
  the python data stack (pandas, numpy, scipy).
- Taught Physical Chemistry and General Chemistry Lab and was
  rated "excellent" by students.

**2013 - 2015**
: **Drexel University**  

*Research Assistant*   
: *Philadelphia, PA*

- Invented a scheme to predict how long electrons take to move
  across a molecule in Python 3 and accelerated the code 30x with Numba.
- Created a method determine how rapidly branched molecules vibrate with reduced
  computational complexity in Fortran 90.
