### Teaching Experience
-----------------------

2015 - 2016
Urbana, IL
:     **University of Illinois @ Urbana-Champaign**

      One semester of Physical Chemistry and one semester of General
      Chemistry Lab. For all courses with evaluations, I was rated by
      students as "excellent."

### Technical Skills
--------------------

2000 Hours
:     **Python**

      Heavy emphasis on numerical computation and data analysis.
      Significant experience using NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.
      Very comfortable with Pandas and Cython. Familiarity with SWIG.
      Used predominately in 2 major projects, as well as dozens of
      smaller ones, including side projects for my own entertainment.

1000 Hours
:     **C++**

      Predominately used in numerical code where performance is a
      premium. I've used C++ both to extend Python by way of Cython, but
      have also written an entire project in C++ using Make, GDB, gcc and
      valgrind.

500 Hours
:     **FORTRAN77/90**

      My first programming language. The code for the March 2016 paper
      was written exclusively in FORTRAN, using only a few of the
      features of the 90 standard.

50 Hours
:     **HTML/CSS**

      I spent a few weekends designing two blogs, including
      [my technical one]({{ site.url }}), and my [collaborative cookbook](https://evanandfriends.github.io/).

1000 Hours
:     **Microsoft Office**

      Wrote papers in Word, used Powerpoint for presentations and excel
      for data analysis from 2006 to the present day.
