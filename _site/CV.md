### Education
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**PhD in Chemistry**
: 2020

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
: Urbana, IL

**BS and MS in Chemistry**
: 2015

Drexel University
: Philadelphia, PA


### Technical Skills
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Data Analysis/Presentation**  
Automated data analysis pipelines using the Python data stack and presented
technical information to expert and layman audiences.

**Method Development**  
Created numerical models to solve problems in computational chemistry by
employing techniques from Linear Algebra and Differential Equations.

**Programming**  
Experienced in creating lightweight, rapid-iterations in scientific python,
as well as highly tuned C++ scaling across a supercomputer.  
  - **Best:** Python
  - **Good:** C++ (11 standard onwards)
  - **Have Used for a Project:** Fortran90  


### Experience
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**2015 - Present**
: **University of Illinois**

*Graduate Research/Teaching Assistant*
: *Urbana, IL*


- Developed a method for predicting how electrons align in solids. This
required the solution of an eigenvalue problem with hundreds of thousands of
degrees of freedom, which was done using high performance, parallel C++ on the
Blue Waters Supercomputer.
- Implemented a deterministic global minimum search algorithm in order to find
better solutions to fundamental
problems in theoretical chemistry and physics.
- Analyzed datasets bigger than 16GB out-of-memory by utilizing the HDF5 file
format in conjunction with the python
data stack (pandas, numpy, scipy, dask).    
- Taught Physical Chemistry and General Chemistry Lab and was
rated "excellent" by students.

**2013 - 2015**
: **Drexel University**  

*Research Assistant*   
: *Philadelpia, PA*

- Created a method detemine how rapidly branched molecules vibrate with reduced
computational complexity in Fortran 90.
- Invented a scheme to predict how long electrons take to move
across a molecule in Python 3. The python module was accelerated with Numba to
achieve very fast execution speed.

**Apr - Sep 2013**
: **Janssen**  

*Biologics R&D Co-op*   
: *Spring House, PA*

- Determine how quickly drugs bind to and release from disease targets using
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). This information informed high-level decisions
about which drug candidates to pursue.

**Apr - Sep 2012**
: **West Pharmaceutical Services**    

*Quality Control Co-op*  
: *Exton, PA*

- Analyzed company and client products with analytical chemistry techniques to
ensure consistency of quality, while applying cGMP and GLP practices.

**Jun - Sep 2011**
: **Drexel University**    

*Undergraduate Research Assistant*    
: *Philadelphia, PA*

- Curated and generated data for the
[Open Science Melting Point and Solubility Databases
](http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/).
