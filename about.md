### The blog

With this blog I'm hoping to make some useful, or at least interesting, posts about programming in python/Cython, and quantum chemistry. Hopefully I'll be able to do some fun stuff with Coffee or food as well!

### About Evan

I'm a third year PhD candidate in computational chemistry at the University of Illinois @ Urbana-Champaign. I like to cook too!
