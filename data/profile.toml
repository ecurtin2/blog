[bio]
tagline = "Principal Applied Scientist shipping LLM systems and evaluation in active litigation workflows"
expanded = """
I build production ML and LLM systems in high-stakes, regulated environments.
I design evaluation, privacy constraints, and deployment together so teams can iterate quickly without guessing.
I work end-to-end across modeling, infrastructure, and product—usually when the problem is ambiguous or production behavior doesn’t match offline results."""

[bio.identity]
whoami = """
I’m a builder. I like shipping systems that keep working after I’m no longer watching them.
I turn vague goals into concrete, testable systems, and I simplify aggressively when complexity isn’t buying reliability.
I’m happiest close to the work, using evaluation and production feedback to learn fast."""
