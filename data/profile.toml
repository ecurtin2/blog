[bio]
tagline = "Applied Scientist with a consistent history of delivering novel models to production"
summary = "I focus on creating systems for efficient evaluation of algorithms to accelerate development via iterative improvements and CI/CD practices."
expanded = """
I specialize in taking ML and LLM ideas from zero to production in high-stakes, regulated environments. \
My work focuses on building systems where experimentation is cheap, failure is safe, and progress is driven \
by reliable evaluation rather than guesswork. I operate across modeling, infrastructure, and product, and \
I am often pulled in when systems behave unexpectedly in production or when teams need to simplify and \
realign around the true problem."""

[bio.identity]
whoami = """
At heart, I'm a builder. I like making things that actually work and keep working after I'm no longer \
paying attention to them. I get satisfaction from turning vague ideas into concrete systems, fixing things \
that are broken or unclear, and leaving behind something simpler and more reliable than what I started with. \
I'm happiest when I'm close to the work and believe that progress comes from understanding the problem better \
rather than adding more complexity."""

highlights = [
    "Developed a method to classify documents for eDiscovery using LLMs (Relativity aiR for Review). Demonstrated human-level+ efficacy, and collaborated with engineering, product and go-to-market teams to support the product's release through various events in USA and Europe. This product has been used in multiple active litigations and on several million documents.",
    "Updated our active learning text classification engine used to find relevant documents for discovery. The engine provides a 10% reduction in overall review effort, while performing 10x faster, as compared to the previous implementation across hundreds of real legal matters.",
    "Designed and implemented scalable evaluation pipelines for both of the above systems to evaluate algorithm updates against sensitive data in a privacy-preserving manner. This enabled 2 teams of scientists to conduct hundreds of experiments in support of novel ML backed products.",
